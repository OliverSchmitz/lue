About
=====
LUE is the result of multiple research projects performed by the
`Computational Geography`_ group at Utrecht University in The Netherlands.
One of the focus areas of this group is to improve environmental
modelling frameworks with respect to their functionality and performance.
The LUE software allows us to test our ideas. Our goal with LUE is to
keep the ideas that work and eventually turn the software into a real
environmental modelling framework that is useful for domain experts.
