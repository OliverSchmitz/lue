```{glossary}
Array
    A collection of {term}`elements <element>` of the same type. An array has a {term}`rank` and a
    {term}`shape`.

Domain
    TODO

Element
    Depending on the context this is the type or the value of a single item in an array. An array contains
    elements.

Field
    A {term}`property` of a {term}`phenomenon` that has values at all locations of a certain {term}`domain`.
    Examples of fields are the elevation within a study area, the gravity of Earth, and the surface
    temperature of Mars.

Partition
    A subset of a larger data structure. Partitions are asynchronously computed and can be distributed over
    multiple processes.

Phenomenon
    TODO

Property
    TODO

Rank
    The number of {term}`array` dimensions.

Scalar
    A single value, representing a {term}`field` that has the same value at all locations in a
    {term}`property`'s {term}`domain`. Scalar values are asynchronously computed.

Shape
    For each array dimension the extent in number of {term}`elements <element>`.
