# Scalability

See the [experiments page](#scalability-experiments) for general information about scalability experiments.
The [quick start page](#scalability-quick-start) describes how to perform such experiments using an example
model. It makes use of the [lue_scalability.py command](#lue-scalability).

```{note}
Use optimized / release builds when performing performance or scalability experiments.
