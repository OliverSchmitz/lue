# Scalability

Scalability is a metric which characterizes how well software is able to make good use of additional hardware,
like CPU cores or cluster nodes. Scalable software makes good use of additional hardware to perform work
faster (strong scalability), or to perform more work (weak scalability). Experiments can be performed with
which to compute scalability efficiencies, for example. This is mostly relevant for developers working on the
LUE software.

See the [experiments page](#scalability-experiments) for general information about scalability and performing
scalability experiments. The [quick start page](#scalability-quick-start) describes how to perform scalability
experiments using an example model. It makes use of the [lue_scalability.py command](#lue-scalability).

```{note}
Use optimized / release builds when performing performance or scalability experiments.
