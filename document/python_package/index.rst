LUE Python package
==================
The LUE Python package allows you to perform I/O to the `LUE Scientific Database`, which is an `HDF5`_ binary data format.

.. note::

    The LUE Python package is currently in development and not ready
    to be used in general. Unless you are involved in the project we
    suggest you come back here once in a while to check on the project's
    status.

The LUE database lets you efficiently store huge amounts of attribute values of huge amounts of objects. These objects can be located in time and/or in space, and the attribute values can be n-dimensional values. The LUE database is `developed <https://github.com/pcraster/lue>`_ by the `PCRaster`_ R&D Team, to be useful in the domain of agent-based and field-based modeling. But the data format is general enough to allow it to be used in other domains as well.
