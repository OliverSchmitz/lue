        @brief      Namespace containing a nicer API around the GDAL C++-API and additional
                    code that makes working with the GDAL library a nicer experience

        The code is useful in other contexts than LUE: lue::gdal doesn't depend on
        anything specific to LUE.

        More information about GDAL can be found online:
        - [GDAL homepage](https://www.gdal.org)
        - [GDAP API reference](https://gdal.org/api/index.html)
