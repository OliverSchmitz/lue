    The I/O module is implemented in terms of the HDF5 C-API. Sometimes the
    HDF5 data model terminology overlaps with our data model terminology, for
    example in the case of 'dataset'. In these cases and in most other
    cases we refer to the HDF5 data model, we prepend the HDF5-specific
    terms with the word 'HDF5', as in 'HDF5 dataset'.
