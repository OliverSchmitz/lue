    @brief  Code related to object arrays

    ## Design
    - Seperate object array packing from active object tracking. Some
        optimizations can be made, which should be handled at a higher
        level. So, nothing in the interface should suggest how active
        objects are tracked.
    - Sometimes, it must be possible to determine what kind of object
        array is stored. Sometimes this information is implied by the
        context. How to determine the object array kind is outside of
        the scope of this abstraction layer.

    In this directory, code is stored for handling spatio-temporal
    objects, in which spatio-temporal object information is combined,
    according to the LUE data model.
