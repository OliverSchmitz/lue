# Quality assurance

Software quality assurance is about verifying that the software meets certain criteria, like correctness,
performance, and scalability. This part of the software currently only deals with scalability. The LUE quality
assurance part contains software that makes performing scalability experiments more convenient. For this we
developed a [C++ API](#source-lue-qa-cxx) and a [Python API](#source-lue-qa-python).
